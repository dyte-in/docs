# Quickstart

Get the `roomName` for the meeting and the participant's `authToken` from our backend APIs (read more about our server APIs [here](/api/)), and pass them as params to Dyte's `Meeting` class.

You can initialize a meeting on your JS enabled web page, like below.

```html
<div id="root"></div>
<script>
  const client = new DyteClient({ clientId: "orgId|clientId" });

  const meeting = client.Meeting({
    roomName: "<roomName>",
    authToken: "<authToken>",
  });

  meeting.init("root");
</script>
```
