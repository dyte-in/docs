# Meetings
The CLI allows you to perform some basic functions with meetings, including creating a meeting and viewing its sessions.

More functionality will make its way here soon.

## Creating a meeting
Creating a meeting is as simple as running:
```
dyte meetings create
```

## Viewing a meeting's sessions
You can view a meeting's sessions by running:
```
dyte meetings info
```
