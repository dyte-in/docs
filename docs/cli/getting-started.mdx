# Getting started

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

The Dyte CLI needs a little bit of work to get started. We're working on reducing the amount of effort required, but for now you'll have to do the following.

## Configuration
1. Set the environment you intend to work in. Most of the times, this is going to be `production`.
```shell
dyte config env -n production
```

2. Authorize yourself with the Dyte Dev Portal. This allows you to access all the organizations that you belong to from the CLI.
```shell
dyte auth login
```

3. Select the organization you want to run commands in the context of.
```shell
dyte auth org
```

## Usage
### General
The Dyte CLI is [POSIX compliant](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap12.html). This means in general, a command has the following format:
```
dyte <command> [subcommand] [options]
```

### Getting help
The `dyte help` command shows you a comprehensive list of all the top-level commands and a short description of what each command does. You can run `dyte <command> help` to know more about the command and its subcommands (if any).
```
~ dyte help
Usage: dyte [options] [command]


                     /////////
                //////////////
